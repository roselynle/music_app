-   [x] Add a controlled form
-   [x] Refactor file structure and use props where appropriate
-   [x] Implement useEffect by fetching data from an API
-   [x] Implement navigation to give the page at least 3 routes

## Wins & Challenges

### Wins
-   Created a webpage that utilises the core concepts of React such as components, state, props, hooks, JSX
-   Managed to write tests and get them to pass

### Challenges
-   Understanding how props work and the best way to utilise them in our webpage
-   Slight difficulties with styling (e.g. isolating styling to one page)

## Bugs

-   Webpage is not fully responsive on mobile devices (e.g. lyrics page)
-   Clicking the button in the lyrics page opens up all the lyrics rather than one container

                Famed hip-hop artist Drake was born to a mixed-race couple in
                Canada in 1986, and raised Jewish. He came to fame playing
                wheelchair-bound Jimmy Brooks in seven seasons of the popular
                teen soap Degrassi: The Next Generation. In 2006, Drake began
                circulating mixtapes of his raps, and signed a record deal in
                2009. His hit songs include “Every Girl,” “Best I Ever Had,”
                “Money to Blow” and “Take Care.” 
                
                <p className="subheading">Early Life</p>
                Drake, the world’s
                only black Jewish-Canadian rap star, was born Aubrey Drake
                Graham on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Canada. Drake grew up
                with music in his blood. His father, Dennis Graham, was a
                drummer for legendary rock star Jerry Lee Lewis, and Drake says
                that his mother, Sandi Graham, also hails from a “very musical”
                family. Drake comes from an eclectic and unique racial and
                religious background. His father is an African-American Catholic
                and his mother is a white Canadian Jew. Speaking about his
                personal identity, Drake says, “At the end of the day, I
                consider myself a black man because I’m more immersed in black
                culture than any other. Being Jewish is kind of a cool twist. It
                makes me unique.” Drake’s parents divorced when he was 5 years
                old, and he was raised by his mother in Forest Hill, an affluent
                and predominantly Jewish Toronto neighborhood. He had a Bar
                Mitzvah at age 13 and observed the Jewish High Holy Days with
                his mother. “My mom has always made Hanukkah fun,” Drake
                recalls. “When I was younger, she gave cool gifts and she’d make
                latkes.” Despite his Jewish upbringing, Drake says he felt
                isolated at Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, his virtually
                all-white high school. Drake remembers, “Nobody understood what
                it was like to be black and Jewish.” However, he also adds,
                “being different from everyone else just made me a lot
                stronger.” 
                
                <p className="subheading">Drake ‘Degrassi’ Star</p> 
                It was one of Drake’s
                classmates at Forest Hill who gave him his start in the
                entertainment industry. “There was a kid in my class whose
                father was an agent,” Drake would later explain, adding, “His
                dad would say, ‘If there’s anyone in the class that makes you
                laugh, have them audition for me.’ After the audition he became
                my agent.” Shortly afterward, in 2001, Drake landed a role on
                the Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation.
                The show follows the dramatic lives of a group of teenagers at
                Degrassi High School, and Drake played the part of Jimmy Brooks,
                sometimes dubbed “Wheelchair Jimmy,” a basketball star who
                becomes permanently wheelchair bound when he is shot by a
                classmate. Drake starred on Degrassi for seven years (2001-09),
                earning a 2002 Young Artist Award for best ensemble in a TV
                series, among other honors. The show quickly developed a devoted
                cult following—”There are very few subtle Degrassi fans,” Drake
                has said—propelling Drake to celebrity status in Canada, even
                while he remained relatively anonymous in the United States.
                
                <p className="subheading">Hip-Hop</p>
                Fame While still staring on Degrassi, Drizzy began
                attempting his transition into the world of hip-hop. He released
                his first mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006, achieving
                modest sales around approximately 6,000 copies. He followed that
                with the 2007 release of another mixtape, Comeback Season.
                Comeback Season included Drake’s first hit single and music
                video, “Replacement Girl,” which was featured as the New Joint
                of the Day on BET’s popular hip-hop television show 106 & Park.
                In 2008, the producers of Degrassi overhauled the cast,
                eliminating Drizzy’s character. Without his steady source of
                income, and not yet making significant money as a rapper, Drake
                was on the verge of looking for a day job. “I was coming to
                terms with the fact that … I might have to work at a restaurant
                or something just to keep things going,” he remembers. But early
                in 2008, Drake received an unexpected call from rap star Lil
                Wayne, who asked Drake to board a flight to Houston that night
                to join his tour. Since that phone call, Drizzy has enjoyed a
                rapid ascent to the top of the music world. After touring and
                recording with Lil Wayne, Drizzy released his third mixtape, So
                Far Gone, in February 2009. It featured the infectiously catchy
                single “Best I Ever Had,” which peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s
                Hot 100 singles chart. Since then, Drake’s barrage of catchy,
                R&B-infused hip-hop songs have dominated radio airwaves. His
                most popular singles at this time included “Every Girl,”
                “Forever” and “Money to Blow.” By mid-2009, Drizzy had inked a
                record deal with Lil Wayne’s Young Money Entertainment.
                
                <p className="subheading">Chart-Topping</p>
                Success On June 15, 2010, Drizzy released his
                first full studio album, Thank Me Later, which debuted at No. 1
                on both American and Canadian album charts and has since been
                certified platinum. Drizzy’s new persona as the cocksure prince
                of hip-hop (“Last name ever, first name greatest,” he brags on
                one track) seems to clash with his middle-class Jewish
                upbringing and former career as a teenage soap-opera star.
                Nevertheless, Drizzy attempts to fuse these seemingly
                incongruous stages of his life into one persona. On the December
                2009 cover of Vibe magazine, Drake sports a diamond-crusted
                Chai, a hip-hop style shout out to his Jewish roots. And in his
                song “The Presentation,” he raps, “Who’s Drake? Where’s
                Wheelchair Jimmy at?” In November 2011, Drizzy released his
                second studio album, Take Care, which included songs like
                “Headlines,” “Make Me Proud,” “The Motto” and “Take Care.” The
                album met with wide acclaim, winning the 2013 Grammy Award for
                best rap album, among several other honors. 
                
                <p className="subheading">Infamous Feud</p>
                Despite his big successes on the music charts, Drizzy has hit a
                few rough patches in his personal life. In recent years, he and
                fellow entertainer Chris Brown have become rivals over singer
                Rihanna. The pair’s bitter feud erupted in violence during the
                summer of 2012 at a New York nightclub. Professional basketball
                player Tony Parker, a male model and two women—all hurt in the
                brawl. Among those who have filed suit against the performers.
                In addition, Drake and Brown began legal proceedings against
                each other in court in early 2013 over who is responsible for
                starting the grisly clash. Around this time, Drizzy settled
                another legal matter out of court. He reached an agreement with
                former girlfriend Ericka Lee. Her contributions to the song
                “Marvin’s Room.” Lee had sued Drizzy in 2012 seeking credit for
                co-writing the track.
